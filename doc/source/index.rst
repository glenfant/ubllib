.. epigraph::

   UBL, the Universal Business Language, defines a royalty-free library of standard XML business documents supporting
   digitization of the commercial and logistical processes for domestic and international supply chains such as
   procurement, purchasing, transport, logistics, intermodal freight management, and other supply chain management
   functions.

   UBL can be thought of as a lingua-franca â€” a (data format) language that allows disparate business applications and
   trading communities to exchange information along their supply chains using a common format.
